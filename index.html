<h2> What is SnackClock?</h2>
<p>SnackClock was designed to examine food intake behavior in rodents with premeasured diets dispensed at set time intervals throughout the day.</p>

<h2> How does it work?</h2>
<p>SnackClock utilizes a 24-hour clock movement, which runs off a single AA battery, connected with two 3D printed pieces to dispense the diets. It is meant to sit on top
of the wire rack such that the diet simply falls through the grates (see picture at top of page).</p>

<h2> Can I build a SnackClock myself?</h2>
<p>Yes!</p>
